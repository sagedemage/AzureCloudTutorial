	<h2>Vi Tutorial</h2>
	<h4><a href="Home.html">Home</a></h4>
	<h3>Introduction:</h3>
	<p>Vi is a visal text editor included by default on Unix operating systems.<br>
	It is a character-based screen editor without a GUI. One of Vi's major draws<br>
	is its ubiquity and accessibility. You don't need a desktop enviornment to use it,<br>
	and it is typically already installed on your system.<br>
	Vi gives users a robust editing experience without ever having to leave the keyboard's<br>
	home row. With a dedicated command mode, Vi utilizes the full keyboard for tasks<br>
	like navigating a file, manipulating text, searching, and replacing phrases
	</p>
	<h3>How to open Vi editor</h3>
	<p>You can open up Vi with the vi command. Generally, if your system uses vim, this command still links<br>
	to it, but you can also use the vim command in that case. You could alternatively, open Vi with a file<br>
	using the vi [example-file.txt], replace example-file with the path to the desired file
	</p>
	<h3>Vi modes</h3>
	<p>Vi has two distinct modes, getting familiar with them helps you get the most out of Vi</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Normal mode: This mode is also known as "command mode" and is the mode where you enter<br>
		most of your Vi commands. Key pressed in normal mode are evaluated as commands and not as text<br>
		entered on the file you are editing.</li>
		<li>Insert mode: This mode is your main place for entering text. Here, your key presses tend to<br>
		operate how you would expect in a text editor. You can enter this mode by pressing the i key<br>
		while you are in normal mode. Alternatively, you can press the o key to insert a new line<br>
		and immediately enter Insert mode.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Common Vi commands in normal mode</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>:e ~/example-file (opens a file in the current user's home directory)</li>
		<li>:w ~/example-file (writes changes to a file, if you want to specify the file to save to,<br>
			add the path after the command</li>
	</ul>
	<div id="navigation">
	<h3>Navigation</h3>
	<p>You can navigate text in Vi using the arrow keys, whether in normal or insert mode. However, in<br>
	normal mode, you can also use the keys in the list below. Some of these keys help keep you from<br>
	laving the home row for the arrow keys, but most add handy and efficient navigation shortcuts</p>
	<ul>
		<li>j (moves the cursor down a line)</li>
		<li>k (moves the cursor up a line)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
	<p>To undo a change, use the u command. You can then redo a change with :redo</p>
	<h3>Copy, Cut, and Paste</h3>
	<p>The base Vi command for copying is y, the list shows you a variety of ways you can quickly define<br>
	what text gets copied</p>
	<h3>Search and Replace</h3>
	<p>Vi uses the / command to start a search. Once you enter the / command, you can begin entering your<br>
	search text. Note that Vi's searches are case sensitive. Pressing enter once you have entered your search<br>
	text takes you to the first instance of that text in the file. You can then navigate the search results using the<br>
	n command to go forward and the N command to go backward
	</p>
	<h3>How to exit Vi</h3>
	<p>To exit Vi, press esc if you're in normal mode then use the :q command.<br> Additionally, if you want to save your changes and exit in a single command,<br>
	you can combine the two commands using, :wq<br>
	You can also exit Vi without saving your changes. To do so, add a ! to the end of the quit command :q!</p>
